The impact of climate change on biodiversity patterns, particularly at broad spatial scales, has been a central focus in modern community assembly theory [@ackerly2003community; @kraft2015community; @harrison2020climate]. However, much of the current research remains limited by the temporal scope of available data. Ecologists critic community assembly studies on their relying on "one-time snapshots" of species distributions to infer long-term processes [@khattar2021determinism; @harrison2020climate; @chang2016integrating]. Such approach als falls short in capturing how species turnover is shaped by climate dynamics over extended geological periods [@weiher2011advances; @fukami2015historical; @dimichele2004long]. The result is a fragmented understanding of how long-term climate change dynamics has influenced species turnover across large spatial scales, especially over timescales relevant to both evolutionary and ecological community assembly processes [@erwin2009climate; @jackson2015community; @jackson2006can].

In addition to the typically evaluated contemporary niche and dispersal based processes, two hypotheses offer a framework to understand climate change’s impact on biodiversity distribution across several time periods. The severity of climate change hypothesis suggests that if the magnitude of climate change drives turnover, then the compositional differences between fossil assemblages in space and over time will increase with larger climatic magnitude deltas. This is because shifts in the average climate conditions of a region over multi-million years may encourage species origination through local adaptation or migration from neighboring regions, while also increasing global extinction and local extirpation rates [@davis2001range; @davis2005evolutionary; @de2022predicted; @vasconcelos2022retiring]. The Climatic Instability hypothesis posits that compositional differences between fossil assemblages in space to be associated with the degree of temporal change in a region’s climate spatial heterogeneity. This is because unstable climates can create new ecological niches within a region that offer opportunities for diversification and extinction, while stable climates lessen the pressures for adaptation, migration, and extinction [@vasconcelos2022retiring; @cavender2016evolutionary; @sonne2022biodiversity; @gerhold2018deep]

Along Earth's history, broad scale climatic changes [@zachos2001trends] create novel pressures that influences species' distributional ranges [@erwin2009climate; @nogues2009predicting; @nogues2018cracking; @alroy2000global]. Thus far, we understand very little the role of these deep time climatic changes in shaping macroscale patterns in biodiversity [@myers2015paleoenm; @benson2021biodiversity; @bartlein1989orbital]. This knowledge can be critical to make informed predictions about past, current, and future biodiversity distribution in light of ongoing climatic changes [@kiessling2023improving; @hagen2023coupling; @nogues2018cracking]. Paleoclimate models—reconstructions of Earth's climate over geological timescales—offer a promising avenue for integration with independent paleoecological data [@hargreaves2009importance; @ludwig2019perspectives; @faith2013climate; @barr2017signal]. By combining paleoclimatic reconstructions, fossil data, and community assembly theory, we can model a relationship between historical climatic changes and the changes the compositional dissimilarity of fossil assemblages at macroecological scales across stratigraphic periods [@naglu2023across; @blanco2021punctuated; @mottl2021global; @jabot2020assessing]. Here we aim to model the compositional dissimilarity of large-mammal fossil assemblages within North America and Europe and during the Neogene period. Specifically, we ask 1) Does the magnitude of climate change influence fossil assemblage dissimilarity? and 2) To what extent do temproal instability and spatial heterogeneity of climate contribute to fossil assemblage dissimilarity? While more extreme climatic shifts are expected to increase turnover through mechanisms such as origination, extirpation, and extinction, their impact on assemblage dissimilarity will be amplified if these shifts are also accompanied by significant climatic instability and fluctuations in spatial heterogeneity.
