Title: Paleoclimate Reconstructions

Author: Oskar Hagen (oskar@hagen.bio)

Description: Cenozoic estimated air surface temperature (EAST) in the Northern Hemisphere at one degree resolution with coordinate reference system (CRS) "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +towgs84=0,0,0".
The file ‘EAST_60to0Ma_Hagen_etal_2019.csv’ contains the x and y coordinates followed by the EAST at the given coordinate and time, starting at 60 Ma and ending at 0 Ma (i.e. present) as indicated by the column names. The file ‘read_paleoclimate.R’ contains code on how to load and convert ‘EAST_60to0Ma_Hagen_etal_2019.csv’ into a raster with the correct coordinate reference system and an example on plotting the Northern Hemisphere estimated air surface temperature at 60Ma.
