  Climate change plays a critical role in shaping biodiversity over extended timescales, yet most insights come from short-term contemporary observations. By examining how climatic shifts have historically driven the movement and redistribution of animal species between different geographic regions (i.e. ecological turnover) during distinct periods in geological time, we can uncover the historical dynamics into the mechanisms that could shape present and future biodiversity patterns in response to ongoing climate change. To address this gap in historical biogeography, here we evaluate two key hypotheses: On one hand, the Severity of Climate Change hypothesis, which posits that faunal turnover follows the magnitude of climatic transitions between regions over distinct time periods, as these extreme changes disrupt ecosystems, forcing species to adapt, migrate, or go extinct. On the other hand, the Climatic Instability hypothesis, which argues that transitions from stable climates to periods of rapid climate fluctuations drive higher faunal turnover by promoting dynamic niche shifts. To test these hypotheses we focus on the large-mammal fossil turnover dynamics within North America and Europe across the Neogene, an epoch marked by major climatic shifts in the Northern Hemisphere.

# Introduction

# Methods

## Data

### Study taxa

Fossils of large mammals are particularly useful to uncover macro-evolutionary trends as they are often preserved with higher spatial fidelity and therefore less prone to taphonomic biases compared to other fossil organisms. Moreover, the results of centuries of paleontological research are now digitally available in aggregated fossil databases with standardized taxonomic nomenclature and geotagged records. For this study, we gathered fossil data from the NOW database, excluding all records where the genus or species was classified as indeterminate ("indet.").

### Temporal scope

The Neogene period (23-2.6 million years ago) provides an ideal case study to test these hypotheses, as this period was characterized by significant climatic changes. This period saw the emergence of many modern plant and animal families, as well as the extinction of many others that were widespread. During this time, the Earth's climate transitioned from a greenhouse to an icehouse state, with the onset of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation around 3 million years ago. These led to the transformation of tropical areas in high latitudes into open landscapes such as savannas and prairies, and the expansion of temperate and boreal forests. These changes were driven by a combination of tectonic and oceanographic events, including the establishment of the modern-day Gulf Stream, the uplift of the Rocky Mountains and the Alps.

The Neogene is divided into several stratigraphic stages based on geologic time. We aggregated fossil observations into categorical stratigraphic ages based on their mid-point betwen the maximun and minumum radiocarbon based age estimates. The **Aquitanian** (23–21 Ma) marks the beginning of the Neogene and is characterized by early Miocene climate conditions. The **Burdigalian** (20–16 Ma) follows, marked by warmer climates, while the **Langhian** (15–14 Ma) and **Serravallian** (13–12 Ma) represent mid-Miocene periods of global cooling. The late Miocene stages, **Tortonian** (11–8 Ma) and **Messinian** (7–5 Ma), involve further cooling and tectonic shifts, culminating in the Mediterranean Salinity Crisis during the Messinian. The Pliocene stages, **Zanclean** (5–4 Ma) and **Piacenzian** (3–2 Ma), feature continued global cooling, setting the stage for the Pleistocene glaciations.

### Region of interest

The study area spans North-America and Europe. We divided continental masses into subregions: Eastern, Central, and Western USA, as well as Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus region. These geographic divisions capture key continental-scale gradients, allowing for analysis of species turnover and the regional variability in climatic effects. We aggregated present-day geographic coordinates of fossil observations using an equal-area hexagonal grid (100 Km spacing) rotated to Phanerozoic stratigraphic stages [@merdith2021extending], aggregating all coordinates within the same grid cell, implemented in the `grid` method of the `paelorotate` function of the `paleoverse` [@Lewis2023paleo] package for `R`. Further, we aggregated fossil' hexagonal binned records into square-gridded fossil paleocommunities, each of of 25 degree squared area. We computed sampling effort per grid as the count of all unique Locality Identification Numbers (LIDNUM), a unique identifier assigned to each fossil locality represented in the NOW database.

### Palaeoatmospheric data

We utilized paleo-atmospheric temperature reconstructions for the Northern Hemisphere (Hagen et al., 2019) as a proxy for macro-scale climatic variation across continental regions and Neogene time periods. The dataset from Hagen et al. (2019) spans the Cenozoic (60 Ma to the present), and we extracted a subset corresponding to the temporal range of our fossil data. To align the spatial resolution of the climate data with that of our fossil paleocommunities (5x5 degree grid cells), we aggregated the 1x1 degree grid cell temperature records by calculating simple means within each 5x5 degree grid cell.

To assess the distribution of temperature across regions within each stratigraphic stage, we aggregated 1 Ma temperature records by calculating simple means. To quantify the magnitude of climate change, we computed the temporal slope for each grid cell by fitting a linear regression model to the 1 Ma temperature records within each stratigraphic stage as a function of time. The slope of this model represents the rate of temperature change, while the standard deviation of the residuals from the regression captures temporal variability in climate for each region within a given stratigraphic stage.

## Statistical analyses

### Broad-scale fossil diversity patterns

#### Taxonomic richness

Our analysis began with quantifying the relative abundance of fossil genera across various grid cells and stratigraphic stages. For each grid cell, we normalized the genus counts by dividing the number of occurrences of each genus by the total species count at that site. This proportional representation enabled meaningful comparisons of genus composition across both spatial and temporal scales.

#### Paleocommunity composition

To evaluate the ecological dissimilarity between regions and time periods, we constructed genus-by-site matrices for each stratigraphic stage. We created these matrices by cross-tabulating the normalized genus abundances against the sites, with the exclusion of any sites lacking fossil records (i.e., those with zero total counts), ensuring our analysis was restricted to regions with available data (at least 3 unique genera recorded). We then calculated pairwise Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between grid cells within each stratigraphic stage. This approach provided an overview of taxonomic turnover of continental fossil communities across different stratigraphic stages.

### Paleoclimatic variables

From Hagen's (2019) 1-million-year (1Ma) resolution paleoclimatic reconstructions, we derived a set of four paleoclimatic variables, each aggregated by stratigraphic period within the Neogene. Specifically, these variables include: 1) **Average atmospheric temperature (t_var)**, calculated as the mean temperature across all 1Ma intervals within each stratigraphic stage; 2) **Magnitude of atmospheric temperature change (t_slope)**, which represents the slope of a linear regression model fitted to the relationship between age and temperature for a given stratigraphic stage; 3) **Atmospheric temperature temporal instability (t_inst)**, measured as the standard deviation of the residuals from the linear model used to estimate t_slope; and 4) **Spatial heterogeneity of atmospheric temperature (t_svar)**, computed as the mean difference between a focal temperature cell and its eight neighboring cells within a stratigraphic period, following the Horn algorithm.

### General dissimilarity modelling

In this study, we applied General Dissimilarity Models (GDM) to explore spatial variation in fossil paleocommunity composition across environmental gradients and stratigraphic stages. GDMs offer a non-linear framework to quantify species turnover across environmental gradients while accounting for spatial effects on ecological dissimilarity. By focusing our analysis on fossil genera instead of species, we minimized biases associated with inconsistent taxonomic resolution across fossil sites. Separate GDMs were fitted to compositional dissimilarity matrices for each stratigraphic stage, modeling compositional turnover as a function of four paleoclimatic temperature variables: average atmospheric temperature (t_mean), magnitude of temperature change (t_slope), temporal temperature instability (t_var), and spatial temperature heterogeneity (t_svar). The geographic distance between fossil paleocommunities was included as a covariate, calculated as the Euclidean distance between site centroids within each paleocommunity grid. The relative contribution of each variable was determined through iterative adjustment of spline functions to maximize the fit between observed and predicted dissimilarity. We then examined how the explanatory power of each temperature variable shifted across stratigraphic stages. Lastly, by transforming and rescaling each environmental predictor to a common scale of biological relevance, we mapped geographic variation in community assembly processes over time, enabling a more meaningful comparison of climatic drivers of species turnover across regions and stages.
